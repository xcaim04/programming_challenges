# 🧠 Competitive Programming & Algorithms

Welcome to my personal repository of competitive programming solutions and algorithm implementations. This space serves as a digital notebook where I document my progress, learnings, and techniques across various platforms and problem sets.

---

## 🌐 Platforms Covered

This repository includes problems solved from:

- [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/)
- [DMOJ UCLV](https://dmoj.uclv.edu.cu/)
- [Matcom Grader](https://matcomgrader.com/)
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)

You'll also find standalone algorithm implementations and data structure templates useful for contests and technical interviews.

## 💻 Languages Used

Primarily:

- **C++** – for speed and control in contests
- **Python** – for readability and quick prototyping

Occasionally, I explore other languages depending on the problem or platform.

## 🎯 Goals

- Practice and improve problem-solving skills
- Prepare for programming contests and interviews
- Build a reference library of reusable algorithms and techniques
- Share knowledge and solutions with the community

---

## 📚 Contents

The repository includes:

- Solved problems categorized by platform and difficulty
- Well-commented code for clarity and learning
- Implementations of classic algorithms (e.g., graph traversal, dynamic programming, number theory)
